/**
 * Payment amounts for operator trips.
 *
 * The trip price is only a DEFAULT. What a traveler owes lives on their own
 * participant row (`price_total_usd` / `deposit_usd`), frozen when they joined.
 * That is why changing a trip's price never rewrites an existing traveler's
 * deal — the same reason an order line stores its own amount rather than
 * pointing at the product.
 *
 * ⚠️ These functions mirror `operator_traveler_amount_due()` in
 * `20260803000000_operator_trip_payments.sql`. If one changes, the other must.
 * The SQL is authoritative — the client copy exists so the Plan tab can show an
 * amount without a round trip.
